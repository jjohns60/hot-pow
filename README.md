## Project Summary

This project involves the integration of multiple thermal datasets including snow temperature profiles from snow pits, continuous ground observing sites, and airborne/satellite retrievals. The objectives include the aggregation of these datasets as well as the use of this information to derive insights about how vegetation and other land surface variables impact surface temperatures. Investigations into the effect of scale and comparisons between various datasets is also explored.
